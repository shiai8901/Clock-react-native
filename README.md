# Clock-react-native
## What your project does
A super simple App to show user the time

## How much time you spent (feel free to call out parts that took more time if any)
Since it's my first time using react-native, so it took me sometime to install and set up the environment. Except for setting up, this project took me about one hour, including learning react-native a little bit through building the App.

## Given additional time, say a whole week, where would you like to have gone with this exercise
If I have a whole week, I would try to build a simple chat App, with following features,
1. User can create an account with username, password. (Since it's only one week, authentication and security will not be the focus part).
2. User can add friends by searching username
3. User can create chatting rooms
4. User can invite friends into chatting rooms
5. User can exit chatting rooms

Stacks:
Front End: react-native, Node.js
Server: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MySQL / Postgresql
